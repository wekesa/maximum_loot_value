### Maximum Loot value
This program tries to help a thief to maximize on the item values that he can take. The problem is that he has a knapsack that can only hold a limited weight (W):

Given a list of value (v)and weight (w), and knapsack limit the program will return a maximum value that a thief can take.

# To run the Program

* On a terminal run `python maximum_loot_value.py`
